# Homework 3 - Storyboards and Wireframes

## Deliverables

This project consists of building and submitting two PDF files. The PDF files are stored in this GITHUB repo and pushed to gradescope for evaluation.

1. A PDF file containing your storyboard. This storyboard should present your overall vision for your mobile app to help faculty learn student names. The PDF can be constructed using any storyboarding software tool (Figma or others) OR can simply be A SINGLE PDF containing one or more assembled pictures of hand-written pages. *Review [this week's readings](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/74903/pages/week-3-readings?module_item_id=2521755) for ideas on how to create storyboards*.
1. A PDF file containing four or more wireframes based on select elements of your storyboard. These wireframes should be created in Figma. Each wireframe should include a brief description documenting the intent of the screen. Select key, important panels from your storyboard for wireframing.

## Instructor comments

THIS IS A ONE-WEEK ASSIGNMENT NOT A SEMESTER LONG PROJECT! We're developing skills by walking QUICKLY through the ENTIRE process, without delving into any one step too deeply.

DON'T GET STUCK! This activity can very easily spiral out of control into something that will totally overwhelm you!

STAY FOCUSED. Do NOT develop the mother of all apps. Do NOT try to include ALL the features that you can think of.

KISS - Keep It Stupid Simple.

MVP - minimal viable product. What are the absolute MINIMUM elements you need to create an app that can help an instructur learn names of students in their class. If you app is awesome, there can always be a version 2.0!

START FROM THE FINISH LINE AND WORK BACKWARD - what does the last screen look like? How did you get there? Working backwards sometimes help keep things focused.

FOCUS ON THE PROCESS - One key learning objective for this assignment is for the *design process* to become second nature: Understand, Analyze, Ideate, Validate, Iterate. ITERATE is the KEY!

## Getting started

TRY COMPLETING THE ENTIRE PROJECT IN JUST ONE HOUR

- Start a timer, then go for it.
- After the hour, STOP and WALK AWAY.
- Come back later and review what you completed. Does it tell your story? Would someone not living in your head be able to understand what you're proposing?
- Determine where you need additional details
- Set another timer and do it again!

YOUR WIREFRAMES MAY CHANGE YOUR STORY - This is a holistic project. If you change one or more of your wireframes (screens), your project workflow (story) might need to change. That's OK. ITERATE.

## Examples

In class we discussed different *modes* for the program, for example, a *training mode* where the instructor can practicing matching names and faces, and a *testing mode* where the instructor is tested and scored.

Your story board might include tracks or paths for both modes.

Your wireframes might focus exclusively on one of the paths.

In my mind I struggle with the actual matching of names and faces - how would this work?  This is where you can be creative and fun and unique. What would this look like? Where would it fit within the larger story? What would the wireframe(s) look like?

## Evaluation Criteria

### Storyboard (30 points)

15 points - completeness (that is, panels are presented for the ENTIRE app.)
10 points - individual panel organization. Is a complete idea conveyed in each panel?
5 points - overall organization and neatness

### Wireframes (20 points)

10 points - Clarity. Are the different elements clearly shown? Is it clear how the elements fit together?
10 points - Intent. Does the intent match the elements included in the screen?

## Background and discussion

We've been exploring a mobile app to help faculty learn student names. In class we worked through different stages of the design process, focusing our conversations around different stages of the double-diamond design process.

The storyboard is a low-fidelity, comic strip like version of your application. The storyboard consists of different panels (some sort of drawing and a corresponding description of what's happening in the panel) connected into some soft of user flow.

A wireframe is a more detailed representation of an individual panel in the storyboard, designed to look more like a polished screen in your mobile app. Wireframes come in a variety of *fidelities* from *low-fi* to *high fi*, each with more detail and polish.

Once complete, individual wireframes can be connected together in Figma to create a working *prototype* that can shared with potential users for feedback. This is called user testing.

There is NO WAY we'll be able to craft a complete storyboard, wireframes, and prototype in this class. There are simply too many things to learn all at once.

We're going to break this project up into pieces and develop a few artifacts for each part of the process. A full-blown design would require building out all of the artifacts!

For this assignment (homework 3) our focus is on developing an overall vision for the application (a storyboard), then selecting a few elements from the story board and developing them out further into wireframes.

Subsequent assignments will further develop the wireframes into a working prototype and finally a coded mobile application.
